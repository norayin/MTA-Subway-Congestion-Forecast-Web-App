# MTA-Subway-Congestion-Forecast-Web-App

## Abstract:
Subway congestion has become one of the main factors that lower the efficiency of MTA subway operations and reduce comfort level for metro users. This project seeks to ensure convenience for metro users and maximize efficiency of subway system by building a web application suggesting metro users when and how they should plan their subway trips based on predicted subway congestion level. There are three parts of this project, including a prediction model forecasting the net entries of metro users at each MTA subway station, congestion score and level computation, and a Shiny web app interface informing metro users about the predicted future congestion level at each MTA station.
